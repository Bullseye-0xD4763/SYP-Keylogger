# SYP-Keylogger
SYP = Stole Your Password. 

A project created with the goal of assessing how difficult it would be to get access to third-party credentials in an Enterprise setting. 
It worked very well.



```python3 
python3 pylogger.py

The program will then export a log.txt file with every key pressed during the program's runtime.
```
