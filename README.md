# SYP-Keylogger
SYP = Stole Your Password. 

A project created with the goal of assessing how difficult it would be to get access to third-party credentials in an Enterprise setting. 
It worked very well.



```bash
python3 pylogger.py
```

```python3 
d' pressed
'a' pressed
's' pressed
'd' pressed
'a' pressed
's' pressed
'd' pressed
's' pressed

```
